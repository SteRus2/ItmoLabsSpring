    ```
    feat: The new feature you're adding to a particular application
    fix: A bug fix
    style: Feature and updates related to styling
    refactor: Refactoring a specific section of the codebase
    test: Everything related to testing
    docs: Everything related to documentation
    chore: Regular code maintenance.
    ```

2. Separate the subject from the body with a blank line
3. Your commit message should not contain any whitespace errors
4. Remove unnecessary punctuation marks
5. Do not end the subject line with a period
6. Capitalize the subject line and each paragraph
7. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
8. Use the body to explain what changes you have made and why you made them.

10. Do not think your code is self-explanatory
11. Follow the commit convention defined by your team
